Considerations for subsequent LLM regression process: Refine the prediction model by correcting overestimations in YS, UTS, and elongation. Prioritize optimizing SHAP-derived weightings for Cu and Mn. Implement robust cross-validation using feature importance and error correction techniques to ensure improved prediction accuracy and alignment with ground truth values.
