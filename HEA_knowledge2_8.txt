**2. LLM Regression Process Considerations:**
The significant prediction errors in elongation values suggest a need for enhanced focus on capturing non-linear relationships and complex interactions in the LLM model. Adjusting the model using more data-driven insights and improving feature selection or engineering could better align predictions with ground truth, especially for elongation, which consistently shows discrepancies.
