Considerations for subsequent LLM regression process: Enhance feature relevance by fine-tuning Cu and Mn influences using advanced cross-validation. Employ additional test data insights to amend weighting errors and improve predictions for YS and UTS. Prioritize reducing discrepancies between LLM predictions and ground truth to boost model accuracy.
