2. **LLM Regression Process Considerations:**
The LLM model predictions significantly overestimate YS and UTS while underestimating elongation, indicating poor alignment with ground truth. The model needs improved non-linear feature interactions and adjustments for imbalanced elongation predictions. Expand data diversity and incorporate domain-informed features to refine predictions.
