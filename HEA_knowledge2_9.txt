2. **LLM Regression Process Considerations:**
Test data reveal significant discrepancies in elongation predictions, indicating a need for model enhancement. Focus on capturing non-linear relationships and interactions, particularly for elongation, is crucial. Incorporate additional feature engineering and data-driven insights to enhance alignment between predictions and actual values. Consider increasing the dataset for better model generalization and accuracy.
