Considerations for subsequent LLM regression process: The current LLM predictions show significant discrepancies, especially in elongation predictions. Focus should be on improving the modelâ€™s ability to capture non-linear interactions and diverse compositions in HEA alloys. Further training with a more comprehensive dataset is crucial for better predictive accuracy.
