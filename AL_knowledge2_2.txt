### Considerations for LLM Regression Process:  
1. **Error Correction**: Adjust to reduce YS and UTS overpredictions (e.g., up to 2.5×) and elongation overpredictions (e.g., ~36×).  
2. **Component Weight Rebalancing**: Reduce bias in overestimated elements (e.g., Cu, Mn) by refining SHAP-derived weightings.  
3. **Cross-Validation**: Incorporate feature importance-based loss function tuning and robust cross-validation to align predictions with ground-truth distributions.
